A 2ーRow aluminum radiator is installed、<END>
providing better cooling and weight<END>
reduction．The oil cooler stabilizes<END>
the oil temperature and keeps the engine<END>
in top condition．<END>
Put in the necessary effort<END>
and perform a wellーbalanced tuning．<END>
 
 
A 3ーRow copper radiator is installed、<END>
providing high cooling effect for <END>
hours of sports driving．<END>
Although heavier、it is the final form of<END>
cooling、and is well worth purchasing．<END>


Inーline、Vーtype、boxer and rotary racing engines<END>
will be swapped in．This is the final form of<END>
engine tuning、with every engine type having<END>
different power and torque characteristics．<END>
We will keep an eye on how the engine swaps<END>
affect the RACING BATTLE scene．<END>


Compared to previous suspension kits、<END>
the spring rate and damping force has<END>
increased．The versatility is appealing for both<END>
street and circuit use．<END>
Interested drivers are encouraged to take<END>
advantage of this product．<END>


Spring rate and damping force have been further<END>
increased compared to those of the previous kit．<END>
This suspension kit is mainly used for racing、<END>
getting unstable at street roads or any<END>
large gaps．What do you think?<END>


Compared to the previous transmission kit、<END>
the drivetrain response has been improved<END>
by reinforcing the transmission mount．<END>
Drivers whp like to drive hard should<END>
consider purchasing this product．<END>


A sequential transmission is installed to<END>
greatly reduce shift lag．<END>
This is the final form of transmission tuning<END>
and is definitely worth getting if you can<END>
afford it．<END>


Comes with a twin plate clutch designed<END>
for high power、that reduces inertia and improves<END>
response．Compared to a regular clutch、it<END>
requires lighter pedal work．<END>
Drivers who are not satisfied with their driving<END>
experience should consider getting this product．<END>


A carbon triple plate clutch with high torque<END>
capacity is installed．<END>
If you can afford it、you should definitely<END>
get this final form of clutch tuning．<END>


A set of brake pads and discs for intermediate<END>
to advanced drivers、suited for everything<END>
from street to sports driving．<END>
Holes and slits are machined on the discs surface<END>
to bring out stable braking performance．<END>
Don't miss out!<END>


A big caliper kit with largeーcapacity pistons is<END>
installed．From rigidity and stability to the size<END>
of the pads、it achieves a level close to those<END>
used in motorsports．The cost is expensive<END>
but the tune is a must for those who want<END>
absolute braking power．<END>


In addition to previous reinforcements、the body<END>
rigidity is further improved．<END>
A pillar bar is installed between the Cーpillars<END>
to further prevent body flex．<END>
After improving the engine、make sure to<END>
reinforce the body to handle the increased power．<END>


In addition to previous reinforcements、the body<END>
is filled in with Polyurethane foam、that hardens<END>
to improve torsional rigidity while keeping<END>
the cost and weight reasonable．<END>
Interested drivers should consider it<END>．


In addition to previous reinforcements、the body<END>
is reinforced with spot welding．Unlike riveting、<END>
this method reduces weight of the vehicle．<END>
If you can afford it、you should definitely get this．<END>



In addition to previous reinforcements、a high<END>
performance roll bar has been installed to<END>
significantly increase safety and overall<END>
body rigidity．<END>
Although it is expensive and increases the<END>
vehicle's weight、it is advised to install it<END>
for the safety of the driver．<END>


In addition to previous weight reductions、<END>
the battery has been downsized and the bolts<END>
and piping have been replaced with lightweight<END>

has been reduced．This tuning should be prioritized<END>
by drivers who primarily race on circuits．<END>


In addition to previous weight reductions、<END>
every seat and seat rails、other than the<END>
driver's、are removed．<END>
Drivers who are not satisfied with their<END>
handling and acceleration should consider<END>
this product．<END>


In addition to previous weight reductions、<END>
interior equipment not required for driving<END>
is removed．<END>
Since electrical equipment can be heavy、<END>
this tuning should not be overlooked by drivers<END>
looking for a higher level of performance．<END>


In addition to previous weight reductions、<END>
the trunk is now made out of carbon、and the<END>
windows are acrylic．Other weight reduction<END>
measures have also been taken．<END>
If you have enough money to spare、you should<END>
definitely consider this weight reduction．<END>
