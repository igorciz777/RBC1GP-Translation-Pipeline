Offsets to different struct fields found in Ghidra from decompiled eeMemory.bin file (PCSX2 Save State)

0x00746fa4 - address, points to the start of rivals structs, which is rival id for Racing Guy No. 1
0x578 - size of one rival struct, 1400 in decimal

struct fields are referenced by an offset in this way: rival_structs_start_pointer + rival_id * 0x578(size) + 0x214(offset for a field)
in that example its a reference to the nickname of rival numbered by rival_id

field offsets:
0x0(nothing) - id
0x2 - unknown, usually 0x00
0x4 - some rival type setting, used in an if to check if its lesser than 0
0x5 - some rival type setting, used in an if to check if its equal to 0, 1 or 2
0xC - controlls the rival's car chassis and wheel size in some wacky way
0x10 - unknown
0x128 - unknown
0x148 - unknown
0x214 - nickname
0x27e - some number before full name, unknown use
0x280 - full name
0x29a - occupation
0x2bc - motto
0x2de - profile bio 1
0x320 - profile bio 2
0x362 - profile bio 3
0x3a4 - dialog 1 line 1
0x3e6 - dialog 1 line 2
